# 3D Image Projection via Linear Algebra üìêüßÆ

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project dives into the fascinating intersection of **Linear Algebra** and computer graphics. It demonstrates how fundamental mathematical concepts like **vectors, matrices, and transformations** (rotation, scaling, translation) can be used to mathematically represent and project 3D objects onto a 2D plane. Essentially, we're bringing 3D space into your 2D screen using the power of algebra!

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **3D Object Modeling:** Representing complex 3D shapes using vertices (vectors) and defining them with matrices.
*   **Perspective & Orthographic Projection:** Implementing the mathematical techniques to flatten 3D objects onto a 2D canvas.
*   **Geometric Transformations:**
    *   **Rotation:** Spinning objects around X, Y, and Z axes.
    *   **Scaling:** Resizing objects uniformly or non-uniformly.
    *   **Translation:** Moving objects through 3D space.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** A real-time Pygame window to see the projections and transformations in action, providing an intuitive understanding of abstract mathematical concepts.
*   **Mathematical Foundation:** Each visual output is directly tied to the underlying linear algebra operations being performed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To get this project up and running, you'll need:

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher recommended.
*   **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations, especially matrix and vector manipulations.
    *   `pip install numpy`
*   **Pygame:** For creating the interactive 2D visualization window.
    *   `pip install pygame`

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run the projection engine on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thebaynal/3D-Image-Projection-Using-Linear-Algebra.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 3D-Image-Projection-Using-Linear-Algebra
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   *(Optional, but recommended for managing dependencies)* If you have a `requirements.txt` file:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` or want to install individually:
        ```bash
        pip install numpy pygame
        ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will launch the Pygame window, showcasing the 3D projection and allowing you to experiment with transformations.

## üì∏ Visual Showcase (Conceptual)

*(In a real README, you'd embed actual screenshots or a GIF here!)*

Imagine seeing a wireframe cube rotating smoothly in a Pygame window. As you interact with the program (perhaps via keyboard inputs), the cube scales up or down, or moves across the screen, with each movement precisely calculated using matrix transformations.

## üí° How it Works (Under the Hood)

The core of this project relies on these linear algebra principles:

*   **Vectors:** Representing points in 3D space (e.g., `[x, y, z]`).
*   **Matrices:** Used to define transformations. For instance, a rotation matrix applied to a vertex vector rotates that point.
*   **Matrix Multiplication:** The key operation for applying transformations. A vertex `v` transformed by matrix `M` becomes `v' = M * v`.
*   **Projection Matrix:** A special matrix that converts 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates, simulating how we see the world.
