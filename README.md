# 3D-Image-Projection-Using-Linear-Algebra

## Description
This project explores how concepts from linear algebra, such as matrices, vectors, and transformations, can be applied to generate and project 3D images onto 2D planes. By utilizing operations like rotation, scaling, and translation, the system demonstrates how three-dimensional objects can be mathematically represented and visualized in 2D.

## Features
- 3D object representation using vectors and matrices
- Projection of 3D objects onto 2d space
- Transformation including rotation, scaling, and translation
- Visualization of results for a better understanding of linear algebra applications

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (for matrix and vector operations)
- Pygame (for visualization)
